There are a lot of reasonably competent and interesting people in the field of software engineering today. I figured 
if I want to make myself even remotely known I need to have a site where I can document my skills, my experiences and 
my accomplishments.

This is my attempt at doing just that.

This site is very bare-bones for now as I'm figured out what content I actually want to put here. I mostly wrote this 
particular post just to get something other than a white screen.

Stay tuned!
