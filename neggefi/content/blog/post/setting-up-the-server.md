+++

I'm an old fashioned guy when it comes to web hosting. I could host this site on any number of free static hosting 
platforms like GitHub pages, but I don't.
 
This site is hosted on an [UpCloud](https://www.upcloud.com/) VPS. To make things more fun and complicated, everything 
is scripted and automated.

The template used when deploying the server has been built with an infrastructure builder 
called [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) in combination with a provisioning tool called 
[Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). The content on the site is generated by a static site generator tool called 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to the server using a deployment tool called 
[Capistrano](http://capistranorb.com/). Yes, that's a lot of software just to get a small website going, but hey, it's 
fun!

Okay, so the site is built with Hugo. I found a reasonable looking theme called 
[Strange Case](http://themes.gohugo.io/strange-case/). It turns out I had to tweak it a little bit because it came 
with things like no differentiating color for links, uncacheable static resources and some other minor issues.

Stay tuned!
